#  Healthcare Cost Prediction

This project predicts individual medical expenses using demographic and lifestyle features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

## 🔍 Objective
Train a regression model that predicts healthcare costs with a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under $3500**.

## 📦 Features
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Standard scaling for numeric inputs
- TensorFlow/Keras model with multiple dense layers
- Evaluation using MAE and MSE

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
##  Goal
Ensure `model.evaluate()` returns **MAE < 3500** on test data.
